              <p>
                For the design challenge(proftaak) we(our proftaak group consisting of 6 persons) had a brainstorm session where we had to come up with 150 possible problems that we would like to solve, at the end 
                we had to choose one problem. Our problem was with the public paper maps at bus stops being unclear. They show you all the lines instead of the line you're interested in.
                <br/>
                After we described our problem we had to come up with a solution for this problem. Our solution is an interactive public transport map application called smartmap. We want to place touchscreens at every bus stop
                where you can interact with the map where you can search for a bus line or select pre defined lines, all possible stops and information about each stop such as the timestamps.
              </p>

              <p>
                This project integrates five different aspects of our study that we've followed in the first 7 weeks. These are:
                <ul>
                  <li>ICT & Technology</li>
                  <li>ICT & Software Engineering</li>
                  <li>ICT & Infrastructure</li>
                  <li>ICT & Business</li>
                  <li>ICT & Media</li>
                </ul>

                The page you are reading now is the documentation page of our backend application, The Smartmap API. We get the data from <a href="https://github.com/skywave/KV78Turbo-OVAPI/wiki/Journey">ovapi</a>
                <br/>Continue reading down below to find a list of all the current possible routes.

              <h2>How it works</h2>
              We have built an interactive web based application that consumes our API data to make it interactive. On launch the default map will be shown and you will have a list selection of 7 possible lines.
              Each line representing the direction and stops for that bus. When clicking on one stop, you will be able to find all information that belongs to that stop.
              <!-- <p>When the application is launched, a map will be shown along side with an user interface of the possible lines you can select. 
                In this example we've chosen to show how our application builds the directions line and provides all possible bus stops on the map. 
                In the end we want to provide the data per stop when you click on one of the stops. -->
